## Problem Statement

customer churn is very important for a business' as it recognizes which customer is likely to stop using their service.

In a telecom industry, customer are able to choose from multiple service provider and switches from one operator to another. In the competitive market telecom industry experiences annual churn rate of 15-20%.It cost around 5-10 times more for acquiring a new customer than to retain an existing customer that's why customer retention is even more important than customer acquisition.

For many operators, retaining high profitable customers is one important business goal.To reduce customer churn companies need to predict which customer are at high risk of churn.
